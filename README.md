# ArchitecturalDebtImplications

## Project Structure

This project contains two folders named `arcan-output` and `designite-output`. 

`arcan-output` contains the results of the projects analyzed with ArcanCLI. All Arcan projects contain the following types of files:

```
--arcan-output
|--CloudShop-MicroService-Architecture
  |-- component-metrics.csv: the list of components (again, classes and packages) and the metrics calculated for each one of them.
  |-- project-metrics.csv: the summary of the metrics of the project.
  |-- smell-affects.csv: the list of what components are aï¬€ected by which smells using the IDs from the component-metrics.csv and smell-characteristics.csv files, respectively.
  |-- smell-characteristics.csv: the list of smells and the characteristics (i.e. metrics for smells) calculated for each instance detected.
|--PartsUnlimitedMRP
  |-- component-metrics.csv
  |-- project-metrics.csv
  |-- smell-affects.csv
  |-- smell-characteristics.csv
|-- . . .
|--ArcanProjectsSummary.xlsx: the summary of the metrics or all projects.

Folder `arcan-output` contains the files generated with the analysis of Arcan

## Instalation of Arcan

1. Once you have a copy of ArcanCLI, create an alias to the arcan.sh file: `$ alias arcan="path/to/arcan.sh"`
2. Use the following command to run the analysis: `arcan analyze -i project-source/ -p output-folder/ -o output --all -t -l JAVA --startDate 2021-03-23 --endDate 2021-03-23 output.writeProjectMetrics=true`. In the above command, replace `project-source` with the folder containing the project you want to analyze; `output-folder` with the folder where the analysis results will be stored; and the parameters `--startDate` and `--endDate` with the start and end dates of the project version you want to analyze.
