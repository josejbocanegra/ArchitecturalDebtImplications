Unutilized Abstraction,Vehicle.Controllers.Mediator,VehiclePublisherHandler,C:\Users\victo\Downloads\PROYECTOS_ACTUALIZADOS\vehicle-tracking-microservices-master\vehicle-tracking-microservices-master\vehicle-tracking-poc\Vehicle\Controllers\Mediator\VehiclePublisherHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Duplicate Abstraction,Vehicle.Controllers.Mediator,VehicleRequest,C:\Users\victo\Downloads\PROYECTOS_ACTUALIZADOS\vehicle-tracking-microservices-master\vehicle-tracking-microservices-master\vehicle-tracking-poc\Vehicle\Controllers\Mediator\VehicleRequest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because two or more abstractions have identical names. The abstractions with identical names are: Vehicle.Controllers.Mediator.VehicleRequest' Vehicle.Models.VehicleRequest
Unutilized Abstraction,Vehicle.Controllers.Mediator,VehicleRequestHandler,C:\Users\victo\Downloads\PROYECTOS_ACTUALIZADOS\vehicle-tracking-microservices-master\vehicle-tracking-microservices-master\vehicle-tracking-poc\Vehicle\Controllers\Mediator\VehicleRequestHandler.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unutilized Abstraction,Vehicle.Controllers,VehicleController,C:\Users\victo\Downloads\PROYECTOS_ACTUALIZADOS\vehicle-tracking-microservices-master\vehicle-tracking-microservices-master\vehicle-tracking-poc\Vehicle\Controllers\VehicleController.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused.   (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
Unnecessary Abstraction,Vehicle.Models,Identifiers,C:\Users\victo\Downloads\PROYECTOS_ACTUALIZADOS\vehicle-tracking-microservices-master\vehicle-tracking-microservices-master\vehicle-tracking-poc\Vehicle\Models\Identifiers.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation' that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ' DomainModel' VehicleDomainModel' VehicleResponseDomainModel
Feature Envy,Vehicle,Startup,C:\Users\victo\Downloads\PROYECTOS_ACTUALIZADOS\vehicle-tracking-microservices-master\vehicle-tracking-microservices-master\vehicle-tracking-poc\Vehicle\Startup.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: Startup which is more interested in members of the type: MiddlewareConfiguration
Feature Envy,Vehicle,Startup,C:\Users\victo\Downloads\PROYECTOS_ACTUALIZADOS\vehicle-tracking-microservices-master\vehicle-tracking-microservices-master\vehicle-tracking-poc\Vehicle\Startup.cs,The tool detected the smell because a method in this type accesses members from another type more than the members from its own type. The method causing this smell is: ConfigureServices which is more interested in members of the type: MiddlewareConfiguration
Broken Modularization,Vehicle.Models,VehicleRequest,C:\Users\victo\Downloads\PROYECTOS_ACTUALIZADOS\vehicle-tracking-microservices-master\vehicle-tracking-microservices-master\vehicle-tracking-poc\Vehicle\Models\VehicleRequest.cs,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields and properties are declared in this class: ChassisNumber' Model' Color' ProductionYear' Country' CustomerId
